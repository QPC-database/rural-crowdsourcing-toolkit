  /worker/{id}:
    put:
      description: Update information about worker. The worker can identify
        themselves using their unique access code or the id token previously
        received from the server. Depending on the identification mechanism and
        the parameters, this request can trigger different types of actions.

        If generate_otp = true, the phone number should be provided as part of
        the request body. The server generates an OTP for the worker. The
        identification mechanism will be the access code, if the request is
        generated for the first time.

        If verify_otp = true, the OTP should be provided as part of the header.
        The server verifies the OTP and generates an ID token for the worker
        that are used as part of subsequent requests.

        If neither of the OTP parameters are true, this request updates the
        "updatable" parameters of the worker, (e.g., gender, age group).
